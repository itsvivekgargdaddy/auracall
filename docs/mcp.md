# MCP Server

`auracall-mcp` is a minimal MCP stdio server that mirrors the Aura-Call CLI. It shares session storage with the CLI (`~/.auracall/sessions` or `AURACALL_HOME_DIR`) so you can mix and match: run with the CLI, inspect or re-run via MCP, or vice versa.

For agent/app workflow patterns, including setup-vs-execution separation,
scoped keys, response batches, attachments, and polling rules, see
`docs/agent-workflows.md`.

## Tools

### `consult`
- Inputs: `prompt` (required), `files?: string[]` (globs), `model?: string` (defaults to CLI), `engine?: "api" | "browser"` (CLI auto-defaults), `slug?: string`.
- Behavior: starts a session, runs it with the chosen engine, returns final output + metadata. Background/foreground follows the CLI (e.g., GPT‑5 Pro detaches by default).
- Logging: emits MCP logs (`info` per line, `debug` for streamed chunks with byte sizes). If browser prerequisites are missing, returns an error payload instead of running.

### `sessions`
- Inputs: `{id?, hours?, limit?, includeAll?, detail?}` mirroring `auracall status` / `auracall session`.
- Behavior: without `id`, returns a bounded list of recent sessions. With `id`/slug, returns a summary row; set `detail: true` to fetch full metadata, log, and stored request body.

### `team_run`
- Inputs: either compact fields (`teamId`, `objective`, optional `title`, `promptAppend`, `structuredContext`, `responseFormat?: "text" | "markdown" | "json"`, `outputContract?: "auracall.step-output.v1"`, `maxTurns`, and bounded `localActionPolicy`) or a prebuilt flattened `taskRunSpec` validated with Aura-Call's live `TaskRunSpec` schema.
- Behavior: creates and executes one bounded team run through the existing `TaskRunSpec -> TeamRun -> runtimeRun` path. The structured result is `object = "team_run"` with `taskRunSpec` and deterministic execution ids/status.
- Agent/team resolution uses the effective config plus user-scoped registry
  catalog, so registry-created teams are executable without rewriting
  `config.json`.
- Provenance: compact MCP-created runs are stamped with `trigger = "mcp"` and `requestedBy.kind = "mcp"`; prebuilt `taskRunSpec` inputs preserve their validated provenance.

### `response_create`
- Inputs: `model`, `input`, optional `instructions`, `runtimeProfile`,
  `agent`, `service`, `transport`, `outputContract`, `composerTool`,
  `deepResearchPlanAction`, `attachments`, and `metadata`.
- Behavior: creates one durable response run through the same stored-step
  response service used by local API `/v1/responses`. Browser-backed ChatGPT
  calls can request volatile workbench tools per call, for example
  `composerTool = "deep-research"` with `deepResearchPlanAction = "edit"`.
  The structured result is `object = "response"` and its `id` can be polled
  through `run_status`.
- Agent model ids resolve through the effective config plus registry catalog.
- `attachments` accepts entries with `id`, optional `fileName`, optional
  `mimeType`, and optional `uri`. Local paths and `file://` URIs become
  browser-uploadable step artifacts; remote URIs are retained for metadata and
  future materialization.
- Polling contract: create the response once, keep the returned `id`, and use
  `run_status` for subsequent state checks. Status readback is file-backed and
  must not resubmit the prompt, reopen a provider tool, or navigate the browser.

### `response_batch_create` / `response_batch_status`
- Inputs: `response_batch_create` accepts `requests` as an array of ordinary
  response-create request bodies, plus optional `metadata`, caller-supplied
  `id`, and batch limits such as `maxConcurrentRuns` and
  `maxBrowserInteractionsPerMinute`. `response_batch_status` accepts the batch
  `id`.
- Behavior: creates one durable response run per request and returns
  `object = "response_batch_status"` with aggregate counts and child
  `responseId` values. Each child remains a normal response run, so operators
  can inspect it with `run_status`. Job rows also expose the child
  `runtimeState` and bounded runtime `diagnostics` when response readback has
  browser/runtime evidence; `runtimeState = "finalizing"` means the provider
  has reached `response-complete` but AuraCall has not yet persisted the final
  child output.
- Polling contract: create the batch once, keep the returned batch id, and poll
  `response_batch_status`. Polling is read-only and must not resubmit student
  prompts, domain prompts, or provider workbenches.
- Enforcement: the API server copies batch limits onto each child run and the
  shared service-host drain path checks them before acquiring an execution
  lease. Runs skipped for a batch gate remain queued for a later drain pass.
  The browser dispatcher and provider politeness controls still provide the
  lower-level CDP/account safety guardrails.

### `project_ensure`
- Inputs: `projectName`, optional `service`, `runtimeProfile`,
  `createIfMissing`, `instructions`, `modelLabel`, `files`, `memoryMode`,
  `agentId`, `agentModelSelector`, `agentInstructions`, `agentPrePrompt`,
  `agentPostPrompt`, and `agentMetadata`.
- Behavior: finds an existing provider project by normalized exact name, or
  creates it when missing. If `agentId` is supplied, it also writes a
  registry-backed agent bound to the resolved provider `projectId` and
  `projectName`.
- Use this as the setup step for project-scoped workflows. Course grading is
  one current smoke, but the contract is intentionally generic: after it
  returns, submit ordinary `response_create` or `/v1/responses` jobs against
  the returned/bound agent id.
- This is a privileged setup tool. Execution-scoped agents should normally call
  the already-bound agent, not create provider projects.

### `run_status`
- Inputs: `id` for a response/runtime run or media generation; optional
  `diagnostics: "browser-state"`.
- Behavior: returns `object = "auracall_run_status"` with a compact status
  envelope across normal response chats, team-runtime chats, and media
  generations. It includes current status, latest event, step summaries when
  available, artifact count, artifact cache path/URI, materialization method,
  provider/runtime metadata, timing, recommended polling interval, and failure
  details. Browser-backed Extended/Pro/Deep Research runs can legitimately stay
  active for minutes to hours; callers should keep polling the same id instead
  of resubmitting.
- Browser-backed response runs can also expose a bounded
  `metadata.browserRunSummary`. For ChatGPT Deep Research `edit` runs, this
  includes the review stage/action, conversation URL, modify-plan label,
  iframe/DOM edit target evidence, and passive screenshot path when captured.
- `diagnostics = "browser-state"` adds bounded live browser evidence when the
  run is active and browser-backed, including recent browser mutation records
  when Aura-Call has recorded navigation/reload/open-reuse activity for the
  selected runtime profile and service.
- Use this as the default operator polling tool when the run type may vary.
- Persistence-safe polling: `run_status` is read-only. Calling it after a fresh
  MCP process start should read the stored response/team/media record by id and
  should not trigger provider execution. If the status payload shows an active
  browser-backed run, poll the same id again instead of calling
  `response_create` or `media_generation` a second time.
- CLI parity: `auracall run status <id> --json` reads the same durable status
  envelope from local storage.

### `search_projection`
- Inputs: accepts optional `query`, `kind`, `provider`, `runtimeProfile`,
  `tenant`, `status`, `fileAvailable`, `assetAvailability`,
  `materialization`, `limit`, and `cursor`. `assetAvailability` may be
  `available`, `unavailable`, or `pending`; `materialization` may be
  `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `skipped`, `failed`, `cancelled`,
  `active`, or `terminal`.
- Behavior: reads the same unified operator search projection as
  `GET /v1/search` and `auracall api search`, merging account-mirror catalog
  rows with run-archive rows without launching provider browsers. Archive rows
  include local file availability and latest archive materialization job
  metadata when present. Archive rows also include compact
  `metadata.assetFreshness` so callers can distinguish newly materialized
  available assets from older archive evidence without reading the full job
  payload. Account-mirror conversation rows include
  `metadata.conversationFreshness` with cache-derived freshness state,
  routeability state, detail/asset completeness, source/rank/fingerprint index
  evidence, and missing-local asset counts. Conversation asset counts are
  projected from both cached transcript context and account-mirror manifest
  assets that are bound to the provider conversation id.
- Paging: returns `nextCursor`; pass that value as `cursor` for the next page.

### `run_archive_search` / `run_archive_item` / `run_archive_backfill` / `run_archive_attach_evidence`
- Inputs: `run_archive_search` accepts optional `kind`, `provider`,
  `runtimeProfile`, `agent`, `team`, `responseId`, `batchId`, `status`,
  `fileAvailable`, `assetAvailability`, `query`, and `limit`.
  `assetAvailability` may be `available`, `unavailable`, or `pending`.
  `run_archive_item` accepts one stable archive `id`. `run_archive_backfill`
  has no inputs. `run_archive_attach_evidence` accepts
  caller-owned evidence with required `producer` and `schema`, optional
  `id`, `status`, `title`, `summary`, `responseId`, `batchId`,
  `archiveItemId`, `providerConversationId`, `data`, and `metadata`.
- Behavior: reads cached AuraCall-created work from the user-scoped archive
  index without provider browser or CDP access. The index covers persisted
  response runs, response batches, team runs, media generations, uploaded input
  artifacts, generated artifacts, provider conversation references, and
  attached evidence records. Runtime-backed archive items preserve raw run
  `status` and expose derived `runtimeState`, so MCP callers can filter for
  transient states such as `finalizing` without parsing response diagnostics.
  HTTP `/v1/archive` and MCP `run_archive_search` both expose cache-state
  filters for `fileAvailable` and `assetAvailability`. MCP
  `run_archive_materialization_create` queues provider-backed asset recovery
  for one generated artifact and accepts `force = true` when a caller needs to
  refresh a stale but locally readable cached asset. Use `search_projection`
  when a caller needs account-mirror rows, cursor paging, or latest archive
  materialization status filters.
- Backfill: `run_archive_backfill` rebuilds that index from existing runtime
  records and is safe for operator repair workflows because it does not touch
  provider pages.
- Evidence attachment: `run_archive_attach_evidence` stores validation,
  review, or post-processing evidence as `kind = "evidence"` so caller
  workflows can make their own audit results searchable beside the underlying
  AuraCall run.
- Use this when an MCP client needs to find uploaded files, generated
  intelligence artifacts, provider conversation ids, or batch evidence without
  knowing AuraCall runtime file paths.
- Boundary: these tools expose evidence; they do not validate domain-specific
  correctness. Caller-owned validators should attach their own evidence rather
  than expecting AuraCall core to know grading, transcript, or literature
  review semantics.

### `history_materialization_create` / `history_materialization_jobs` / `history_materialization_job` / `history_materialization_cancel`
- Inputs: create accepts a provider conversation target (`provider`, optional
  `runtimeProfile`, `browserProfile`, `boundIdentityKey`, `conversationId`,
  `providerConversationUrl`, and `projectId`), a selected `conversationIds`
  batch, `catalogItemId`, `catalogKind`, `archiveItemId`, or `reconcile`. It
  also accepts `refreshSnapshot`, `assetKinds`, `maxItems`, and `force`. List
  accepts optional `status`, `provider`, `runtimeProfile`, `sourceType`, and
  `limit`; job/cancel accept one `id`.
- Behavior: queues and reads durable `history_materialization_job` records. The
  service treats account-mirror history as a discovery index, then uses the
  provider conversation materializers to recover artifacts/files through the
  managed browser/provider path. Successful local files are written into the
  conversation attachment cache and upserted into the run archive as
  `account_mirror` rows so Search, archive, and asset routes see the same
  availability. Reconciliation target selection uses manifest assets bound to
  the provider conversation id as well as row count fields, so a refreshed
  account-mirror manifest can enqueue materialization even when the cached
  conversation row's older count fields are stale. Automatic bulk
  `reconcile=true` selection also uses conversation freshness evidence:
  fresh/complete rows are skipped unless forced, stale/partial/missing rows can
  be selected for `refreshSnapshot` reconciliation even when cached asset counts
  are zero, and terminal/guarded rows are not retried unless forced.
  Reconciliation with
  `assetKinds` containing `media` can also match unavailable media-generation
  archive rows to cached Gemini
  conversations by provider conversation id, unambiguous exact prompt/title,
  cached-media evidence, or nearest timestamp-backed exact prompt/title and
  resume the media-generation materializer. An explicit `archiveItemId` for a
  media-generation generated artifact uses the same media-history matching path
  before ordinary conversation materialization. Direct provider conversation
  evidence on the archive row can drive materialization even when that
  conversation is not present in the account-mirror catalog; legacy null
  runtime/identity archive evidence inherits explicit request selectors unless
  there is a concrete conflict. Duplicate title-only Gemini matches are skipped
  with explicit media-recovery evidence counts for cached media, timestamps,
  and cached artifacts/files before provider browser work.
  Grok media reconciliation records an explicit unsupported skip because Grok's
  resumed image materializer can only inspect the active Imagine/files surface,
  not a matched historical conversation.
  `refreshSnapshot = true` composes a current provider context read before the
  materialization phase and persists `result.phases.snapshotRefresh` plus
  `result.snapshotRefreshes` on the job. Terminal snapshot evidence, including
  Gemini direct navigation falling back to bare `/app`, skips materialization
  for that conversation and records the provider reason on the same job.
  Snapshot refreshes and materialization phases also update cached conversation
  row evidence when a row is available, and direct provider conversation id
  reconciliation can upsert a minimal cached row when provider routeability or
  detail evidence exists but the mirror list did not already contain that
  conversation. Provider hard stops such as `google.com/sorry`, CAPTCHA,
  reCAPTCHA, and visible human-verification pages fail the durable job as
  `provider_guard_required` with HTTP 409 semantics so MCP clients can ask for
  manual clearance before retrying.
- Boundary: account-mirror catalog and catalog-item tools remain cache-only.
  Call `history_materialization_create` only when an operator or agent
  explicitly wants provider recovery work. `history_materialization_cancel`
  cancels queued jobs; already-running provider work is not abortable yet.

### `api_status`
- Inputs: `port` for the local `auracall api serve` listener; optional `host`,
  `timeoutMs`, `expectedAccountMirrorPosture`, and
  `expectedAccountMirrorBackpressure`. Live-follow severity can be asserted
  with `expectedLiveFollowSeverity` (`healthy`, `backpressured`, `paused`, or
  `attention-needed`). Completion-control assertions are also available with
  `expectedCompletionActive`, `expectedCompletionPaused`,
  `expectedCompletionCancelled`, and `expectedCompletionFailed`.
- Behavior: reads the local API `/status` endpoint and returns the same compact
  scheduler summary used by `auracall api status`, including
  `scheduler.operatorStatus.posture`, wake reason, latest mirror backpressure,
  `scheduler.latestYield` when scheduler history contains a cooperative yield,
  `scheduler.foregroundWork` when API/service work is holding live follow back,
  and `completions` metrics plus active/recent controlled live-follow
  operations. Structured output also includes `liveFollow.severity` and
  `liveFollow.line`, a compact operator summary combining scheduler posture,
  completion counts, backpressure, and latest cooperative-yield evidence. It
  does not launch browsers, touch CDP, submit provider work, or read provider
  pages.
- Use this when an MCP operator needs to assert lazy mirror readiness or
  backpressure, or fail fast on live-follow control posture, without shelling
  out to the CLI. `account_mirror_status` remains the cache-only per-target
  mirror status tool; `api_status` is specifically for the running API service
  posture. Per-target mirror status includes the effective politeness limits,
  including `maxBrowserInteractionsPerMinute`; Gemini's default status should
  show the slower six-interaction-per-minute browser pacing unless service
  `liveFollow` config overrides it.
- Smoke: after `pnpm run install:user-runtime`, run
  `pnpm run smoke:mcp-api-status` to start short-lived local API servers and
  verify installed MCP `api_status` reports `disabled` and `scheduled` mirror
  scheduler postures.
- Installed ops-browser smoke: after `pnpm run install:user-runtime`, run
  `pnpm run smoke:mcp-ops-browser` to start a fixture local API server and
  verify installed MCP lists and calls `api_ops_browser_status`.
- Deterministic repo smoke: run `pnpm run smoke:scheduler-history` to start a
  short-lived local API server with an injected yielded scheduler pass and
  verify the HTTP scheduler-history route, CLI scheduler-history reader, CLI
  status summarizer, MCP `account_mirror_scheduler_history`, and MCP
  `api_status` all report the queued work owner and resume cursor.

- Deterministic completion-control smoke: run
  `pnpm run smoke:completion-control` to start a short-lived local API server
  with an injected completion service and verify `POST /status` pause, CLI
  helper resume, MCP cancel, `/status` readback, and compact `api_status`
  completion posture without provider or browser dispatcher access.
- Deterministic foreground-deferral smoke: run
  `pnpm run smoke:foreground-deferral` to resume a paused fixture live-follow
  completion under foreground backpressure and verify
  `foreground_work_deferred` status plus scheduler diagnostics readback with
  zero provider refresh calls.
- Deterministic scheduler-preemption smoke: run
  `pnpm run smoke:scheduler-preemption` to inject a foreground-yielded
  scheduler pass into an isolated local API server and verify API/CLI status
  report target-level `operator_preempted` with zero provider refresh or
  completion work.
- Deterministic health parity smoke: run `pnpm run smoke:live-follow-health`
  to start one fixture-backed local API server and compare `/status.liveFollow`,
  CLI `api status`, MCP `api_status`, and `/ops/browser` against the same
  live-follow health projection without provider or browser dispatcher access.
- Deterministic hydration smoke: run `pnpm run smoke:completion-hydration` to
  seed a paused live-follow completion in a temp cache, restart the API over the
  same cache, and verify `/status`, CLI status, and MCP `api_status` preserve
  active paused posture without provider or browser dispatcher access.
- Deterministic dashboard-control smoke: run
  `pnpm run smoke:ops-browser-control` to verify `/ops/browser` completion
  buttons are wired to `POST /status` with `accountMirrorCompletion`, then
  exercise that path against a fixture live-follow completion. The smoke also
  checks `auracall api ops-browser-status` and MCP `api_ops_browser_status`,
  which fail fast when packaged dashboard control wiring drifts from linked
  `/status` readback.
- Installed MCP dashboard-control smoke: run `pnpm run smoke:mcp-ops-browser`
  to verify the packaged `auracall-mcp` binary lists `api_ops_browser_status`
  and can call it against a fixture local API server.
- Lazy-live-follow operator preflight: run
`pnpm run preflight:lazy-live-follow` to execute the no-browser completion,
foreground-deferral, scheduler-preemption, hydration, health, dashboard, operator API-key
issue/client-auth, user-runtime install, and installed MCP status plus
log-tail checks as one release gate before live dogfood.

### `config_entities_list`
- Behavior: reads the effective AuraCall agent/team catalog. The returned
  `agents` and `teams` arrays include config-defined entries and enabled
  registry-backed entries with source/revision metadata, plus a `conflicts`
  array when duplicate ids resolve by config-wins compatibility.
- This is read-only and does not launch browsers or mutate provider state.

### `config_agent_upsert`, `config_agent_delete`, `config_team_upsert`, and `config_team_delete`
- Behavior: mutate the user-scoped agent registry by default and return the
  effective catalog with `mutationTarget`, source, and revision metadata.
- Config-defined overlay ids are pinned. Mutation attempts against those ids
  return `mutationTarget = "blocked"` with a `blockedReason` rather than
  writing a hidden registry row behind the config overlay.

### `config_snapshot_export` and `config_snapshot_import`
- Behavior: export selected effective agents/teams to
  `object = "auracall_agent_registry_snapshot"` and import that snapshot into
  the user-scoped registry.
- `config_snapshot_export` requires either `all = true` or at least one agent
  or team id. The snapshot is reviewable JSON and is not treated as the hot
  mutable store.
- `config_snapshot_import` supports `dryRun`. Config-defined overlay ids remain
  pinned and are reported as blocked rather than imported behind the config
  overlay.

### `api_key_issue`
- Behavior: privileged local operator tool that writes an additional
  agent/team-scoped key into `~/.auracall/api.env` and returns
  OpenAI-compatible `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `model` values for
  the caller.
- Optional `clientEnvPath` writes a separate scoped handoff file for the
  execution agent. That file contains `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `AURACALL_MODEL`, `AURACALL_STATUS_URL`, and `AURACALL_BATCH_URL`.
- Scope validation uses the effective config plus registry catalog, so
  registry-backed agents and teams can receive scoped keys.
- Restart `auracall-api.service` after issuing a key. The running API process
  reads the systemd environment file at process start.
- This tool assumes local trusted MCP stdio. Do not expose it through a remote
  MCP surface until AuraCall has explicit principal/role enforcement for
  privileged agent-management operations.

### `agent_setup_package_create`
- Behavior: privileged composed setup tool that ensures a provider project,
  binds a registry-backed AuraCall agent, issues a scoped API key, and writes
  a scoped client handoff file in one call.
- Required inputs include `service`, `runtimeProfile`, `projectName`,
  `agentId`, and `clientEnvPath`. Optional inputs mirror `project_ensure` and
  `api_key_issue`, including `agentModelSelector`, agent instructions,
  `keyId`, `apiBaseUrl`, `envPath`, `services`, `runtimeProfiles`, and
  `overwrite`.
- Use this only when a privileged operator needs the full one-time
  secret-bearing setup response. Prefer `agent_setup_handoff_create` for normal
  downstream agent handoff.
- Restart `auracall-api.service` after issuing the key so the running API
  process reloads the service env file.

### `agent_setup_handoff_create`
- Behavior: privileged composed setup tool with the same inputs as
  `agent_setup_package_create`, but it returns only non-secret handoff metadata:
  project status/id, model id, scoped key id/scopes, generated client env path,
  and restart/source hints.
- The generated scoped secret is written into `clientEnvPath`; it is not
  returned in structured content.
- Use this as the default setup tool for privileged agents preparing work for
  downstream scoped execution agents.
- Restart `auracall-api.service` after issuing the key so the running API
  process reloads the service env file.

### `api_key_diagnostics`
- Inputs: optional `envPath`, defaulting to `~/.auracall/api.env`.
- Behavior: reads API-key metadata from the env file and returns
  `object = "auracall_agent_registry_diagnostics"` without returning any
  secret values. The report includes effective agent/team counts, disabled
  registry records, config-vs-registry conflicts, API-key ids, missing scoped
  agents/teams/runtime profiles, and team-derived effective agent reachability.
- Use this before handing a generated key to another agent and after restarting
  the API service to verify the key id still maps to the intended agent/team
  scopes.

### `api_ops_browser_status`
- Inputs: `port` for the local `auracall api serve` listener; optional `host`,
  `timeoutMs`, `expectedLiveFollowSeverity`, `expectedCompletionPaused`, and
  `expectedCompletionActive`.
- Behavior: reads `/ops/browser`, asserts the Mirror Live Follow controls use
  `POST /status` with an `accountMirrorCompletion` payload, reads linked
  `/status`, and applies live-follow/completion-count expectations without
  launching browsers or provider work. The dashboard contract also checks that
  browser-process diagnostics are wired to `GET /v1/browser/processes`, where
  process launch `about:blank` arguments are reported separately from actual
  open blank DevTools page targets.
- Output: dashboard contract booleans plus the same structured status summary
  returned by `auracall api status`.

### `account_mirror_scheduler_history`
- Inputs: `port` for the local `auracall api serve` listener; optional `host`,
  `timeoutMs`, and `limit`.
- Behavior: reads
  `GET /v1/account-mirrors/scheduler/history[?limit=10]` from the running API
  service and returns the compact scheduler-history payload. It does not launch
  browsers, touch CDP, submit provider work, or read provider pages.
- Use this when an MCP operator needs recent lazy mirror pass history, the
  latest cooperative-yield event, resume cursor, or no-yield proof without
  parsing `/status`.

### `account_mirror_scheduler_diagnostics`
- Inputs: `port` for the local `auracall api serve` listener; optional `host`,
  `timeoutMs`, `provider`, `runtimeProfile`, and `completionId`.
- Behavior: reads `GET /v1/account-mirrors/scheduler/diagnostics` from the
  running API service and returns the same target/wait/cache/completion/latest
  event bundle used by the dashboard and
  `auracall api scheduler-diagnostics`. When the selected provider/runtime
  profile matches the running API profile, the bundle also includes recent
  in-process browser mutation records without attaching to CDP.
- Use this when an MCP operator needs a compact handoff bundle for one
  scheduler wait row without opening `/ops/browser` or touching provider pages.

### `account_mirror_completion_start`, `account_mirror_completion_list`, `account_mirror_completion_status`, and `account_mirror_completion_control`
- Inputs: start accepts optional `provider`, `runtimeProfile`, debug-only
  `maxPasses`, `sweepMode = steady_follow|full_sweep`,
  `materializationPolicy = metadata_only|recent_missing_assets|full_missing_assets`,
  `materializationAssetKinds`, `materializationMaxItems`,
  `materializationRefreshSnapshot`, and `materializationForce`; list accepts
  optional `provider`, `runtimeProfile`, `status`, `activeOnly`, `limit`, and
  `detail = summary|full`; status accepts a completion `id` plus the same
  optional detail selector; control accepts `id` plus
  `action = pause|resume|cancel`.
- Behavior: start returns an `account_mirror_completion` operation immediately.
  Without `maxPasses`, the operation runs as `mode = live_follow`: backfill
  history until no more history is detected, then stay in `steady_follow` and
  periodically crawl for new content. List/status default to a bounded,
  side-effect-free summary suitable for monitoring. `detail = full` is an
  explicit one-off diagnostic mode that refreshes materialization status and
  returns the complete persisted receipt; it must not be polled. Status reports
  queued/running/idle_waiting/paused/completed/blocked/failed/cancelled, mode,
  sweep mode, phase, pass count, next eligible attempt, latest refresh, mirror
  completeness, materialization policy, and the latest
  `materializationCursor` when a refresh pass queued a history-materialization
  job. Bounded and live-follow operations do not become successfully terminal
  while that owned job is queued or running; a failed owned job produces
  `status = blocked` with `account_mirror_materialization_failed`. Full-sweep
  completions default to `full_missing_assets` and snapshot
  refresh; steady-follow completions default to metadata-only unless an
  operator or service `liveFollow` config opts into asset materialization.
  Full-sweep completion refreshes use an extended collector timeout to tolerate
  conservative provider pacing.
  Steady-follow refreshes restart attachment/detail inventory at the current
  top of the provider rail/project list, while full-sweep refreshes resume the
  persisted deep attachment cursor. Gemini discovery includes both the left
  rail and Gem/project conversation histories, with bounded project-history row
  budget distributed across Gems/projects before deepening one history and
  tolerated per-Gem route failures.
  Operation records are file-backed under the account-mirror cache and hydrated
  when the MCP service starts, so status readback survives process restarts.
  List readback returns recent or active persisted operations without touching
  provider browsers. Control pauses the service loop, resumes it, or records a
  terminal cancellation without launching or navigating provider pages.
- Use this instead of long-running shell commands when an operator wants the
  service to own mirror backfill and steady follow.
- Smoke: `pnpm run smoke:completion-control` proves
  `account_mirror_completion_control` cancels through the MCP handler after
  `POST /status` pause and CLI resume have both updated the same service
  operation.

### `runtime_inspect`
- Inputs: one runtime lookup key, `runId`, `runtimeRunId`, `teamRunId`, or
  `taskRunSpecId`; optional `runnerId`; optional `probe: "service-state"`;
  optional `diagnostics: "browser-state"`.
- Behavior: returns `object = "runtime_run_inspection"` with the same bounded
  runtime queue/lease projection exposed by
  `GET /v1/runtime-runs/inspect`. `probe = "service-state"` adds live
  provider state for the active step. `diagnostics = "browser-state"` adds a
  bounded browser snapshot for the active step: selected target URL/title/id,
  document readiness, visible control counts, provider evidence, recent
  browser mutation records, and a stored PNG screenshot path.
- This is read-only and does not expose raw JavaScript evaluation or unfenced
  DevTools access.

### `runtime_runs_recent`
- Inputs: optional `limit` from 0 to 100, optional
  `sourceKind: "team-run" | "direct"`, and optional
  `status: "planned" | "running" | "succeeded" | "failed" | "cancelled"`.
- Behavior: returns `object = "list"` with the same compact recent runtime-run
  rows exposed by `GET /v1/runtime-runs/recent` and the `/agents` dashboard:
  run id, source kind, team/task aliases, status, timestamps, step counts,
  service ids, and runtime profile ids.
- This is local-state only. It does not launch browsers, touch provider pages,
  or acquire dispatcher access.

### `media_generation`
- Inputs: `provider: "gemini" | "grok"`, `mediaType: "image" | "music" | "video"`, `prompt`, and optional `model`, `transport`, `count`, `size`, `aspectRatio`, `outputDir`, `wait`, and metadata.
- Behavior: creates one request through Aura-Call's shared media-generation contract and returns `object = "media_generation"` with durable artifact metadata. `wait = false` returns a running media id immediately so callers can poll `media_generation_status` or `run_status` while browser execution is active. Browser-backed Gemini/Grok media jobs wait through the browser-service operation dispatcher before provider adapters touch CDP; timelines can include `browser_operation_queued` and `browser_operation_acquired` when another operation owns the same managed browser profile or raw DevTools endpoint. Provider execution may still fail when the requested provider capability is unavailable or unsupported. Grok browser image requests are preflighted through `grok.media.imagine_image` on the explicit `/imagine` entrypoint and fail before prompt submission when the account is gated. Grok image requests scrape up to `count` currently visible generated tiles, defaulting to 8, without scrolling the wall to trigger more provider work. Grok browser video requests preflight `grok.media.imagine_video` with `discoveryAction = "grok-imagine-video-mode"`, submit through the active `/imagine` tab, poll the submitted tab for terminal generated-video evidence, and cache the MP4 through the provider download control when available. A diagnostic Grok video readback probe can poll an already-submitted tab when metadata explicitly includes `grokVideoReadbackProbe = true`, `grokVideoReadbackTabTargetId`, and `grokVideoReadbackDevtoolsPort`; it direct-connects to that tab and does not submit, navigate, reload, or fall back to browser-service target resolution.
- Provenance: MCP-created media requests are stamped with `source = "mcp"` in the structured response metadata.
- Polling contract: create the media generation once, keep the returned
  `media_generation.id`, and poll with `media_generation_status` when callers
  need media-specific timeline/artifact diagnostics or `run_status` when they
  need the generic cross-run envelope. Do not call `media_generation` again for
  status; that creates a new provider job.

### `media_generation_materialize`
- Inputs: `id` for a stored media generation, optional `count`, optional
  `compareFullQuality`, and optional metadata.
- Behavior: resumes the configured provider media materializer for one existing
  media-generation record and returns the updated `object = "media_generation"`
  response. MCP calls stamp the resumed materialization request with
  `source = "mcp"` in the materializer options. Use this for explicit artifact
  recovery or full-quality refreshes instead of creating a second
  `media_generation` job.
- Boundary: this is direct media-generation materialization parity with the
  CLI/API materialize surfaces. History-backed account-mirror recovery still
  goes through `history_materialization_create`.

### `media_generation_status`
- Inputs: `id` for a stored media generation; optional
  `diagnostics: "browser-state"`.
- Behavior: returns `object = "media_generation_status"` with current status,
  latest timeline event, full timeline, artifact count, artifact cache path,
  materialization method, checksum, preview/full-quality comparison fields
  when available, failure details when present, and derived `diagnostics` from
  the persisted timeline. The diagnostics block summarizes capability
  preflight, submitted tab, provider route progression, artifact
  polling/progress counts, terminal run-state counts, and materialization
  source without re-invoking the provider.
- `diagnostics = "browser-state"` adds bounded live browser evidence for a
  running browser-backed media job, using the recorded provider `tabTargetId`
  when present. The same diagnostics payload includes recent browser mutation
  records when available.
- Use this for polling a long-running media request without re-invoking the
  provider or inspecting raw JSON.
- Persistence-safe polling: this tool reads the stored media-generation record
  by id. It can be used from a fresh MCP process and must not submit another
  prompt, refresh the provider workbench, or materialize additional artifacts
  unless a separate materialization command is explicitly invoked.

### `workbench_capabilities`
- Inputs: optional `provider: "chatgpt" | "gemini" | "grok"`, optional `category: "research" | "media" | "canvas" | "connector" | "skill" | "app" | "search" | "file" | "other"`, optional `runtimeProfile`, optional `includeUnavailable`, optional `diagnostics: "browser-state"`, optional `entrypoint: "grok-imagine"`, and optional `discoveryAction: "grok-imagine-video-mode"`.
- Behavior: returns `object = "workbench_capability_report"` with known or discovered provider workbench capabilities, provider labels, invocation modes, surfaces, availability, stability, required inputs, output expectations, and safety flags. This is read-only discovery and does not invoke provider tools. `diagnostics = "browser-state"` adds bounded target/document/provider evidence and a stored PNG screenshot path for the selected provider. `entrypoint = "grok-imagine"` opens or reuses Grok `/imagine` through browser-service control-plane attribution before inspection. `discoveryAction = "grok-imagine-video-mode"` may click the Grok Imagine Video radio for an explicit mode audit, records before/after controls plus bounded `videoModeAudit` evidence, and restores the original Image/Video mode without typing or submitting a prompt. Grok `/imagine` provider evidence can include `run_state`, pending, terminal image/video, media URL, materialization-control signals, controls, and discovery-action evidence when visible.
- Volatility: static catalog entries use conservative `unknown` or `account_gated` availability until browser/provider discovery confirms the current account state. ChatGPT feature-signature discovery separates installed plugin inventory, linked/authentication state, and current composer visibility. Installed inventory alone does not prove current selection; `Connect`, `AUTH_REQUIRED`, and `REAUTH_REQUIRED` remain account-gated, and legacy page-token matches remain `unknown`. Discovery does not install, reconnect, enable, or invoke an app. Selectable apps report `invocationMode = composer_mention`. Grok discovery can report visible Imagine image/video evidence without submitting a generation request.

## Resources
- `auracall-session://{id}/{metadata|log|request}` — read-only resources that surface stored session artifacts via MCP resource reads.

## Background / detach behavior
- Same as the CLI: heavy models (e.g., GPT‑5 Pro) detach by default; reattach via `auracall session <id>` / `auracall status`. MCP does not expose extra background flags.

## Launching & usage
- Installed from this checkout:
  - `pnpm run install:user-runtime`
  - `auracall-mcp`
- From the repo (contributors):
  - `pnpm build`
  - `pnpm mcp` (or `auracall-mcp` in the repo root)
- mcporter example (stdio):
  ```json
  {
    "name": "auracall",
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "auracall-mcp",
    "args": []
  }
  ```
- Project-scoped Claude (.mcp.json) example:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "auracall": { "type": "stdio", "command": "auracall-mcp", "args": [] }
    }
  }
  ```
- Tools and resources operate on the same session store as `auracall status|session`.
- Defaults (model/engine/etc.) come from your Aura-Call CLI config; see `docs/configuration.md` or `~/.auracall/config.json`.
